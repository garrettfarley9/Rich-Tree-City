# Rich-Tree-City
##Data scraping
I pulled mean housing data from Zillow.com and correlated it with cities that were Tree City USA cities and those that are not.

##Data wrangling
The R files have the data manipulation and processing to get into an appropriate form to upload into ARCGIS.

##Final product
The final product pdf file is the output of the ARCGIS work.
